# CBETA_Chromaticity_Analysis
Analysis of my CBETA multi-pass chromaticity measurement using Mathematica.

[21/10/2021] The h.txt and i.txt data are fieldmap tracking data of BPM positions for the CBETA ERL for the FA/FB arc (i) and ZX straight (h) from the CBETA Virtual Machine. The data is of the form: energy (eV) x (mm) y (mm) error.
